# Jupyter notebook markdown generator
These .ipynb files are Jupyter notebook files that convert a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs are the ones I used to create my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com). I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files.
