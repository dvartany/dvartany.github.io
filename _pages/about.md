This is the front page of your Github pages website, using the [academicpages Jekyll theme](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). This repository was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose, and extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.

You can use all kinds of markdown here. See [the guide](/markdown/).
