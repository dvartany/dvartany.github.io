This is the front page of your Github pages website, using the [academicpages Jekyll theme](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). This repository was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose, and extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.

## A data-driven personal website
The academicpages Jekyll theme is based on markdown files for each type of content, with metadata for various variables stored in YAML sections at the top. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the _talks directory. At the top of each markdown file is structured data about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this python file or Jupyter notebook).
