# Jupyter notebook markdown generator

These .ipynb files are Jupyter notebook files that convert a TSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. `publications.ipynb` is up to date and well documented, and it contains info about the proper format for the TSV. The code in this notebook is also in `publications.py`. Talks is not up to date and needs to be updated and documented.
