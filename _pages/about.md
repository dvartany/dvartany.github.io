I am a Hubble Einstein Fellow at Carnegie Observatories. I was previously a postdoc at Berkeley/LBL as a joint TAC and ECP fellow. I received my Ph.D from Princeton University, studying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) theory through multi-dimensional simulations.

My research interests probe the role of both large-scale and small-scale effects, from rotation to neutrino-matter microphysics, to better understand these Titans of Nature.

You can find my CV  [here](http://dvartany.github.io/files/CV-2023.pdf) and email me at [dvartanyan@carnegiescience.edu](mailto:dvartanyan@carnegiescience.edu).
