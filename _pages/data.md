We include some of our publicly available data here.
  
For our gravitational wave signatures from our 2023 paper (submitted to PRD) for 11 late-time, 3D simulations of CCSNe,
click [here](http://dvartany.github.io/files/low_mass.zip) for the strains, [here](http://dvartany.github.io/files/quadrupole.zip) for the quadrupole components, with the data summarized in this [README](http://dvartany.github.io/files/README.txt).


For our neutrino signatures for 100 2D models, see [here](http://dvartany.github.io/files/BH.zip) for the 37 models that form black holes and do not explode, [here](http://dvartany.github.io/files/low_mass.zip) for models from 9-15 solar masses, and [here](http://dvartany.github.io/files/high_mass.zip) for models from 15-27 solar masses. The data is summarized in this [README](http://dvartany.github.io/files/README-2D-neutrino).
